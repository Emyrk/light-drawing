# Light Drawing

# find_brush.py

```
# To use webcam
python3 find_brush.py -c 

# To use an image
python3 find_brush.py -i IMAGE_SRC
```

Press 'spacebar' or 'c' to clear the drawing

# gamestart.py

```
# To use webcam
python3 gamestart.py 
```

This is what we will build our project out from, but
you can use find_brush.py for debugging.
