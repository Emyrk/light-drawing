# Light Drawing

# Installation

Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads) and [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) for your platform. Then, run the following to install project dependencies and start a subshell in the virtual environment:

```
pipenv shell
```

For full Pipenv usage, see `pipenv -h`.

# find_brush.py

```
# To use webcam
python3 find_brush.py -c 

# To use an image
python3 find_brush.py -i IMAGE_SRC
```

Press 'spacebar' or 'c' to clear the drawing

# gamestart.py

```
# To use webcam
python3 gamestart.py 
```

This is what we will build our project out from, but
you can use find_brush.py for debugging.
